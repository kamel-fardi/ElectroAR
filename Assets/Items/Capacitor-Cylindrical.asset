  description: 'Capacitor (Cylindrical Electrolytic):



    Cylindrical electrolytic
    capacitors are known for their high capacitance values in a small form factor.

    They
    are polarized, meaning they have a positive and negative lead that must be correctly
    oriented in a circuit.

    These capacitors are commonly used in power supply
    circuits to smooth out voltage and prevent ripple.

    They are crucial in the
    filtering stage of AC to DC converters, ensuring a stable DC output.

    In
    audio amplifiers, they couple audio signals between stages while blocking DC.

    They
    are used in timing circuits, where they charge and discharge at predictable rates.

    Electrolytic
    capacitors are often found in flashlights and camera flashes as energy storage
    devices.

    They are used to maintain power for memory or real-time clocks
    in electronic devices during power loss.

    In motor start circuits, they provide
    the necessary initial surge of current.

    They assist in voltage regulation,
    maintaining steady voltages in fluctuating power supplies.

    Electrolytic
    capacitors can be found in electronic ballasts to help start and run fluorescent
    lamps.

    In signal processing, they are used for bass filtering due to their
    large capacitance.

    They are essential in pulse circuits, delivering quick
    bursts of energy.

    In medical devices, they power defibrillation and other
    high-energy functions.

    Their high capacitance is leveraged in power backup
    systems, providing short-term energy storage.'
