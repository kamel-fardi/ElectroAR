  description: 'DC motor (Direct Current motor) is a type of electric motor that
    runs on direct current. It''s widely used in robotics, remote-controlled cars,
    and various other applications. It converts electrical energy into mechanical
    energy through the interaction of magnetic fields.


    In Unity, if you''re
    working with a DC motor as part of a physical project, for example in an Arduino
    or Raspberry Pi setup, you''ll need an interface that connects Unity with your
    hardware. Below is a high-level approach and a script that might help with controlling
    a DC motor from Unity via a connected device like an Arduino.'
