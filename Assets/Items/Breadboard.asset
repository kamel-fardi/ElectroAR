  description: 'Breadboard:

    

    A breadboard is a solderless device for
    prototyping electronic circuits with a grid of holes.

    It''s made of white
    plastic and contains interconnected metal strips to form a circuit without soldering.

    Components
    and wires are inserted into the holes to create temporary connections.

    The
    central area is split into columns for components, with rows reserved for power
    rails.

    Breadboards are essential in educational environments for teaching
    circuit design.

    They allow for quick changes in circuit layouts, fostering
    an experimental approach to learning.

    Breadboards are used in testing circuit
    ideas before committing to a permanent design.

    They are commonly used by
    hobbyists for DIY projects and small-scale prototypes.

    In the development
    phase, engineers use breadboards to debug and refine circuits.

    They are
    excellent for creating and testing simple circuits, like blinkers and timers.

    Breadboards
    can be used to prototype computer hardware and microcontroller projects.

    They
    facilitate easy access to connections for measurement and modification.

    Breadboards
    are used in robotics for quickly assembling and testing control circuits.

    They
    are not suitable for high-frequency or high-power circuits due to parasitic capacitance
    and resistance.

    For permanent use, circuits prototyped on breadboards are
    often transferred to a printed circuit board (PCB).'
