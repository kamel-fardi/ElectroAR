  description: 'Capacitor (Film):



    Film capacitors are made by sandwiching
    a thin plastic film between two metal plates.

    They are non-polarized and
    can be used in AC and DC applications.

    Their construction allows for very
    low inductance and high frequency operation.

    Film capacitors are known for
    their stability, reliability, and long-term performance.

    They are used in
    power supply filters to reduce voltage ripple and noise.

    In audio circuits,
    film capacitors pass audio signals with minimal distortion.

    They are employed
    in high-frequency applications such as RF coupling and decoupling.

    Film
    capacitors serve in motor run applications, aiding in efficient operation.

    They
    are also found in lighting ballasts to improve power factor and reduce harmonic
    distortion.

    In timing circuits, they maintain accurate oscillation frequencies
    with resistors.

    Film capacitors are used in snubber circuits to absorb voltage
    spikes.

    They are preferred in pulse applications, handling high current
    surges without degradation.

    In power circuits, they are used for energy
    storage and transfer in resonant converters.

    Their self-healing properties
    make them suitable for high-voltage applications.

    Film capacitors are integral
    in renewable energy systems, such as solar inverters and wind turbines.'
