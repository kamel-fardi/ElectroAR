  description: A buzzer typically emits sound when a voltage is applied. The buzzer
    can be activated by sending a HIGH signal (usually 5V for an active buzzer) or
    deactivated by sending a LOW signal (0V). In some cases, you may control the
    frequency of the sound produced by the buzzer, but for simplicity, we will start
    by toggling it on and off.
