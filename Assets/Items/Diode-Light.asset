  description: 'Diode (Light Emitting - LED):



    Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)
    are specialized diodes that emit light when current passes through them.

    They
    are energy-efficient light sources used in a wide range of lighting applications.

    LEDs
    come in various colors, determined by the semiconductor material and construction.

    They
    are used as indicator lights in devices to signal power, status, or warnings.

    In
    displays, LEDs provide backlighting for LCD screens or form individual pixels
    in LED screens.

    They are increasingly used for general lighting due to their
    long life and energy savings.

    LEDs are found in traffic signals, automotive
    headlights, and street lighting.

    They are essential in optocouplers, which
    electrically isolate different parts of a circuit.

    In medical devices, LEDs
    are used for phototherapy and endoscopic lighting.

    They are integral to
    modern sensors, providing the light source for detection and measurement.

    LEDs
    are used in remote controls, emitting infrared light to send signals.

    In
    signage and billboards, LEDs provide bright and controllable illumination.

    They
    are used in architectural lighting to enhance aesthetics and visibility.

    LEDs
    are preferred in portable electronics due to their low power consumption.

    They
    also have applications in horticulture, providing specific light spectra for
    plant growth.'
